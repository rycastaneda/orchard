# Skills Test for Orchard

I used a vanilla webpack configuration, needed to modify path images to support production and development. 

For CSS, I used tailwind utility classes except for the modal functionality because its easily readable using traditional CSS. 

Layout was done using CSS Grid, images are using the 2X version on larger viewports, regular version on mobile for optimization. Modal functionality will load the 2X version.
